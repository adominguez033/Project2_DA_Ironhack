## Introduction

This repo contains the work done in the second project of the Data Analytics Bootcamp (June 2022). During the fisrt week, SQL language has been taught. This project entails cleaning different datasets, for later introduce in the database, as well as create the database, its tables, relationships among them.


## Data cleaning.

Data cleaning has been done for the different datasets. Process: 

1. **Data import & raw data information.** 

1. **Null values data cleaning** 

1. **Determination of data type per column**

1. **Data export to csv** 


## Database, tables and relationships creation through Workbench.

Once data has been cleaned, the next step has been to create the database, the different tables (as well as the different columns in each table and its data type) and finally, the relationships between the different tables.


## Data import.

Previous to launch queries, the cleaned data needs to be imported ino the created databse. This has been the hardest part of the project, since several error appeared because of errors incurred in previous steps.


## Queries.

In order to taste the databse, final step has been to launch queries:
### Query nº1: Join of titles and actors

### Query nº2 : The most workable actors - aka Mario Casas in 2015

### Query nº3 : The films with more actors - aka "Valentine's Day" (half Hollywood as cast)

### Query nº4 : Actors that act in the films with more actors

### Query nº5 : The most popular categories

### Query nº6 : Most popular actors by categories

End of Project 2!!
